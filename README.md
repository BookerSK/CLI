Central Limit Theorem: From Theory to Practice
📊 Understanding Statistical Significance Through Practical Examples
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that explains the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its practical applications in data analysis and A/B testing.
🎯 What You'll Learn

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT): Understanding how sample means distribute
Law of Large Numbers: Why larger samples give more reliable results
Practical A/B Testing: Applying CLT to real-world marketing scenarios
Statistical Significance: How to determine if your results are meaningful or just random noise

🏋️ The Gym Exercise Machine Example
The notebook walks through an intuitive example using gym equipment to demonstrate:

How small samples can be misleading (n=3)
Why larger samples converge to the true mean (n=100)
How distributions of sample means form a normal distribution
